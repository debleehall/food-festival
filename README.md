#### OSU Bootcamp
This website was used to teach Module 19 (Progressive Web Application - PWA). 

***Module 19 skills learned:***
* Measured performance metrics for a website using Chrome DevTool's Lighthouse app.
* Performed audits to expose performance flaws which are especially critical when dealing with slower mobile devices on sluggish networks.
* Learned how to use an automated build tool like webpack to bundle assets through a dependency graph to optimize performance by lazy loading and minification.
* Used service workers to cache the websites assets for offline functionality.
* Offered installable icons for quick access to our app using PWAs.
